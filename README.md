# Guildcraft SkyBlock
In this github repo you will find the files of the latest version of our custom official texture pack to get an improved experience while playing. You will need to use optifine if you want to enjoy all the textures of the pack.
This texture pack adds texture to all the nether custom items, as well to most of the items from skyblock+

# How To install a texture pack
  1. Download the texture pack, from discord, in game (with the command /texturepack) or from github in the green button that says "code" (you will have to download the zip version and unzip it, only once)
  2. Go to  your resource pack folder, you can find it, going to Settings, Resource Packs and clicking on the bottom left button that says "Open Pack Folder"
  3. Paste the SkyBlockPack.zip into the folder
  4. Activate the pack by moving it to the "Selected" texture packs
  5. Click on "Done"
